## **Question 1**

```{r echo=FALSE}
## dependencies
library(ggplot2)

myFunction <- function(x){
  y <- (cos(4*x) + tan(0.5*x))^4
  return(y)
}

ggplot() +
  stat_function(
    fun = myFunction,
    xlim = c(0, 1),
    n = 1000
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "x",
    y = "h(x)"
  )
```

## **Question 2**

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Example: Scatterplot of 'mtcars' dataset
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, 
     main = "Scatterplot of Weight vs MPG", 
     xlab = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
     ylab = "Miles Per Gallon", 
     pch = 19, col = "blue")
```

## **Question 3**

### (a)

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
tortilla_data <- read.csv("tortilla_dat.csv")

# Filter data for 2007 and calculate the average price across all six states
avg_price_2007 <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  summarise(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
avg_price_2007
```

### (b)

```{r}
# Filter data for 2024 and calculate the average price across all six states
avg_price_2024 <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(year == 2024) %>%
  summarise(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
avg_price_2024
```

### (c)

```{r}
# Calculate percent change
percent_change <- ((avg_price_2024$average_price - avg_price_2007$average_price) /
                   avg_price_2007$average_price) * 100
percent_change
```

### (d)

```{r}
# Calculate yearly averages
avg_price_yearly <- tortilla_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the average price over time
plot(avg_price_yearly$year, avg_price_yearly$average_price, type = "o",
     main = "Average Tortilla prices (2007–2024)",
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Average price (MXN)")
```

### (e)

```{r}
# Summary statistics and table for 2016
summary_2016 <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(year == 2016) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_price = min(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_price = max(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_price = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
summary_2016

# Table of average prices
knitr::kable(summary_2016[, c("state", "avg_price")],
             col.names = c("State", "Average price (MXN)"),
             caption = "Average Tortilla prices by State (2016)")

# Create side-by-side boxplots for each state in 2016
tortilla_2016 <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(year == 2016)

ggplot(tortilla_2016, aes(x = state, y = price, fill = state)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Tortilla Prices by State (2016)",
    x = "State", 
    y = "Price (MXN)",
    fill = "State",
    caption = "Figure: Boxplots of Tortilla Prices in 2016 across States."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate state names for better readability
```

### (f)

```{r}
# Filter data for Nuevo León and group by store type
nuevo_leon_data <- tortilla_data %>%
  filter(state == "NuevoLeon") %>%
  group_by(year, storeType) %>%
  summarise(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

# Overlapping plot
ggplot(nuevo_leon_data, aes(x = year, y = average_price, color = storeType)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Tortilla Prices in Nuevo León by Store Type (2007–2024)",
    x = "Year", y = "Average Price (MXN)",
    caption = "Data grouped by store type (small businesses vs. large corporations)."
  )

```

### (g)

```{r}
# Include an image of a tortilla
knitr::include_graphics("tortilla.jpg")
```
